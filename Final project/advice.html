    <h4 id="item-1">Nutrition</h4>
    <p>One of the fundamental keys to having a healthy dog is what – and how much – he eats. Our experts advise on what and how
    much to feed your dog, which vitamins and nutrients he needs, and more.</p>
    <h5 id="item-1-1">What to Feed Your Puppy Based on Their Breed ?</h5>
    <p>While a toy puppy may increase its birth weight by a factor of 10 to 20, a giant-breed puppy may grow to be 100 times bigger than when he was born. Consider this: A newborn Chihuahua may weigh only three ounces at birth and three pounds at maturity. A newborn Great Dane, however, may weigh only one pound at birth and 100 pounds at maturity. To get each to its adult weight in the healthiest manner, you’ll need to not only feed them different amounts of food, but also different types of food.

Large Breed Puppies
For years, breeders thought the best way to produce a big dog was to heap his bowl full of protein, calcium, and calories. But when a large-breed puppy grows too quickly, we learned, he can develop problems in the bones and joints. Consider the following:

Protein is important for building muscle, which in turn helps develop sound joints. Large-breed puppies should eat a puppy food with about 26 percent protein.
Calcium is needed for strong bones, but too much can cause just as much harm as too little. When too much calcium is absorbed, the body deposits it on bone tissue whether the bone needs it or not, causing bone reshaping and skeletal abnormalities.
Calories are vital for growth, but puppies who consume too many calories and grow too heavy have a higher risk of osteochondrosis, hip dysplasia, and other joint problems. Very young puppies can eat a calorie-rich food since they need at least twice the calories per pound that adult dogs do, but as they age, they require fewer calories per pound. A diet with about 15 percent fat provides enough calories for growth but few enough to prevent the rapid growth that can encourage skeletal disease.
What’s a large-breed owner to do? First, remember: Ultimate size at maturity is genetically programmed; puppies that grow slower will still reach their adult size, just a little later. Don’t be in a rush to grow them big. Also, don’t make the mistake of feeding smaller amounts of regular puppy food to cut calories because that wouldn’t contain enough calcium. The best bet is to feed a commercial food specially formulated for large-breed puppies. Don’t add supplements (unless instructed by a veterinarian) and don’t overfeed.</p>
    
<h5 id="item-1-2">How to Choose the Best Dog Food ?</h5>
    <p>2 Ways to Read
    QUICK (2 MIN.) IN-DEPTH (5 MIN.)
    Most people feed their dogs dry kibble or canned wet food. These processed foods might not be appealing to us, but they
    contain all of the nutrients dogs need to stay healthy. Quality commercial dog foods are highly regulated and have
    undergone rigorous testing by veterinary specialists.
    
    Dogs, unlike cats, are not strict carnivores. While meat makes up the majority of their diet, domestic dogs can also
    derive nutrients from grains, fruits, and vegetables. These non-meat foods are not simply fillers, but can be a valuable
    source of essential vitamins, minerals, and fiber. A good dog food will contain meat, vegetables, grains, and fruits.
    The best dog foods contain high-quality versions of these ingredients that are appropriate for your dog’s digestive
    system.
    
    If you are unsure about the differences in nutritional requirements between puppies and adults, the Merck Veterinary
    Manual lists the recommended nutrients for dogs, along with the recommended amount by weight and age. Large breed dogs
    and puppies have different nutritional requirements than small breed dogs and puppies.
    
    One way to decipher a good dog food from a bad dog food is to read the label. Check for ingredients, nutritional
    adequacy, and feeding guidelines.

    <h4 id="item-2">Are Dogs Playing or Fighting? How to Evaluate Rough Play</h4>
    <p>If two dogs are wrestling and it seems too rough to you, with all that growling and snarling, body-slamming, and biting
    of each other’s necks, should you intervene? How can you tell if dogs are playing or fighting?
    
    This is normal dog play. Puppies play with their littermates constantly. From around two weeks, when their eyes open,
    until they go to their own homes, they spend almost all of their waking hours wrestling with each other. It’s a critical
    time for social development because it is when they learn bite inhibition and good dog manners. It is good exercise and
    socialization for them and fun for us to watch. But you should learn how to tell the difference between playing and a
    real fight when adult dogs are involved.</p>
    <h4 id="item-3">Behaviors that say it’s all good fun ?</h4>
    <p>The play bow – front end down, back end in the air. Sometimes the dog trying to initiate play will slap his front legs
    down on the ground repeatedly.
    A big, silly open-mouthed grin.
    Exaggerated, bouncy movement. The dogs are acting silly.
    Loud, continuous growling and snarling; again, exaggerated. Play-growling may sound scarier than serious fighting.
    The dogs voluntarily make themselves vulnerable by “falling” down and exposing their bellies and allowing themselves to
    be caught when playing chase. They take turns chasing each other.
    They keep going back for more. Even the dog that ends up on his back doesn’t want to stop playing. They will probably
    take turns with most play-fighting behaviors.
</p>
    <h5 id="item-2-2">Behaviors that tell you this is not a game</h5>
    <p>The dogs’ bodies get very stiff. Hackles (the hair on a dog’s upper back) are raised. You may not be able to see this if
    the dog has long hair.
    Closed mouth, curled lip, low warning growl.
    Movements will be quick and efficient – no bouncing around, no taking turns.
    Ears will be pinned flat and lips curled back and snarling. No big silly smiles.
    If the dogs get into actual combat, hopefully it will be a short encounter, and the “loser” will try to leave the area.
    There won’t be going back for more play.
    The dog is trying to get away from the other one, and her body language is not happy and bouncy. Tail is tucked. She
    isn’t having fun.</p>
